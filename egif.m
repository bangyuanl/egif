%   Modified from the code provied by Dr. Kaiming He et. al. for their paper 
%   "Guided Image Filtering", by Kaiming He, Jian Sun, and Xiaoou Tang, in ECCV 2010   
%   The code and the algorithm are for non-comercial use only.

%   - guidance image: I (should be a gray-scale/single channel image)
%   - filtering input image: p (should be a gray-scale/single channel image)
%   - local window radius: r
%   - regularization parameter: eps

function [q,beta] = egif(I, p, r, eps)

eps0 = (0.001)^2;

[hei, wid] = size(I);
N = boxfilter(ones(hei, wid), r); % the size of each local patch; N=(2r+1)^2 except for boundary pixels.

mean_I = boxfilter(I, r) ./ N;
mean_p = boxfilter(p, r) ./ N;
mean_Ip = boxfilter(I.*p, r) ./ N;
cov_Ip = mean_Ip - mean_I .* mean_p; % this is the covariance of (I, p) in each local patch.

mean_II = boxfilter(I.*I, r) ./ N;
var_II = mean_II - mean_I .* mean_I;

a = cov_Ip ./ ( var_II + (eps .* mean2(var_II)) + eps0 ); % eqn.(13)
b = mean_p - a .* mean_I;

mean_a = boxfilter(a, r) ./ N;
mean_b = boxfilter(b, r) ./ N;

gamma = 1.0;
beta = ( ( mean_a ./ (1-mean_a)) ) .^ gamma; % eqn.(27)
